# Infinex

This is a Django based website which eases the way applications are filled in recent times,
solving a major issue for not thousands but lakhs of students accross the country and may well
later on helping students around the globe as well. 
The modules for both the user side as well as admin sie are listed below.

User side modules

- View college lists: This functionality is one of the most crucial ones offered by our web
  application Infinex. Students can view different colleges’ application procedures and
  amount payable for the same. It is found that many times students are not able to fill up
  the college forms on time. Hence, this feature allows them to be up to dae about the
  deadlines and required documents, processes for application submission. We try to
  include many popular colleges’ entrance application forms such as BITSAT, VITEEE,
  JEE, etc. This can be updated by the admin/superuser of Infinex for conveying specific
  information.
  
- Application submission: It is found that submitting various documents together can
  create chaos and often some important documents are not submitted. We try to remove
  this chaos by creating a common form for all the necessary documents required by the
  students while filling a college application. After surveying 20 colleges’ application
  procedures we noted down the common documents for all these colleges and supplied a
  unique interface to store them. Not only document submission but users can submit them
  for approval of the admin and determine whether a particular candidate is suitable for the
  applied colleges or not.
  
- Document storage: After filling Infinex application form, users can verify their details,
  view and edit them accordingly. If a user requires a particular document they can
  download the same. This collectively reduces the time taken to gather documents. Hence
  this functionality benefits the user in two ways, first it acts as a storage portal and
  secondly improves the efficiency of document collection.
  
Admin side modules

- Updating application status: Admin has access to the applications sent in by users.
  He/she can accordingly review the form and verify whether the student is eligible for the
  particular college. This helps students in getting an idea regarding the chances of
  successful entry in that college. Admin can also add comments to help students get
  feedback regarding their documents.
  
- Approval of applications: With the number of high candidates in every competitive
  exam, it is natural that some applications are going to be rejected if the details are not
  appropriate. Admin can reject or approve the application and users can view their status
  accordingly. The interface for admin allows to easily place and view rejected as well as
  approved documents. The documents yet to be verified are in the pending category.
  
- Viewing submitted documents: Documents are verified by the admin and if there are
  any discrepancies, the admin can convey the same information to the user. This allows for
  verification of the documents and helps in the application procedure.
  Updating college application procedure: To help the students understand various
  college admission processes and approaching deadlines, this functionality displays the
  procedure conveniently and in layman terms. This allows students from all walks of life
  to participate in the admissions.
